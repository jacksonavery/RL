# A roguelixe project
Doesnt really do anything yet but im getting there.

current plan is an xcom eu/ew -like with actually procedural maps

also planning on ascii-esque art, but projected onto orthographic 3d old JRPG style, and with support for (rather, expectation of) modern .ttf fonts. However, I only plan on using characters from english and a limited set (JIS第1・第2水準ぐらい) from japanese. 

I've started a screenshot folder so that there's a record of progress being made.
