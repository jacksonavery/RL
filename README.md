# A roguelixe project
Doesnt really do anything yet but im getting there.

current plan is an xcom eu/ew -like with procedural maps and no character death (!)

text character-based art, but projected onto orthographic 3d old JRPG style. Instead of a 256 character limit, we're unicode-based, allowing much greater potential. At the moment only supports a custom c64-based font with considerable extension into the unicode plane, but there are tentative plans for a vector based font to ship as well.

I've started a screenshot folder so that there's a record of progress being made.
